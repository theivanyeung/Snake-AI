# snake-ai
A deep neural network capable of winning the game "Snake".

Using the genetic algorithm, hundreds of DNNs (deep neural networks) were created and initialized each generation with thousands of generations being trained. 

In this repository, I have included the development/training environment where I trained the snake, a testing environment where you can test out different models and how their compare on the gameboard, and also a game environment in which is playable for anyone to try.
